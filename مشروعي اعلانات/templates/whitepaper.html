            <h2>Smart Coin Labs Whitepaper</h2>
            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Smart Coin Labs aims to create a decentralized advertising platform where users are rewarded with TON
                cryptocurrency for their attention. This whitepaper outlines the core principles, technological
                framework, and economic model of our ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>2. Vision and Mission</h3>
            <p>Our vision is to empower users by giving them control over their data and attention, while providing
                advertisers with a highly engaged audience. Our mission is to make cryptocurrency earnings accessible
                and transparent for everyone, fostering a new paradigm in digital advertising.</p>

            <h3>3. Core Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ad-Watching Rewards:</strong> Users earn TON for every ad viewed.</li>
                <li><strong>Telegram Integration:</strong> Seamless login and notifications via Telegram.</li>
                <li><strong>Referral System:</strong> Users can earn additional rewards by inviting new members.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Withdrawal System:</strong> Secure and transparent withdrawal process with admin
                    oversight.</li>
                <li><strong>Admin Panel:</strong> Comprehensive tools for managing users, ads, and withdrawals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Technology Stack</h3>
            <p>The Smart Coin Labs platform is built on a robust and scalable technology stack:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (Python) for API services and business logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL/Supabase (or SQLite for initial deployment) for data storage.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript with modern design principles (glassmorphism,
                    Poppins font).</li>
                <li><strong>Telegram Bot API:</strong> For user authentication, notifications, and interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>TON Blockchain:</strong> For cryptocurrency transactions and balance tracking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Economic Model</h3>
            <p>Users earn $0.50 TON for every 50 ads watched. A referral system incentivizes user growth, with referrers
                earning a percentage of their referred users' ad-watching rewards. Withdrawal requests are processed
                manually by administrators to ensure security and prevent fraud.</p>

            <h3>6. Security and Privacy</h3>
            <p>User data privacy is paramount. We implement industry-standard security measures for data protection and
                Telegram login verification. All transactions are recorded transparently in the database.</p>

            <h3>7. Future Development</h3>
            <p>Future enhancements include automated TON payouts, advanced ad targeting, community governance features,
                and integration with more blockchain networks.</p>
